# hello-world
This repository was created for the purpose of Project 1, to familiarize myself with the basic operations and functions of GitHub. 

Good Evening, I am writing this to make and commit changes, a function I have never used on GitHub. My name is Samuel Myers, I am 21 years old, and am turning 22 this upcoming friday, September 11th. My hobbies are running, swimming, reading, and playing video games. I have three cats, named Otis, Mocha, and Meowmers.
